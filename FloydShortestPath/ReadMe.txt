Given a directed, weighted graph, consisting of  nodes and there are edges ,of specified length between some of them in the graph.

Given  questions, inquring the shortest distance between a queried pair of nodes in the graph.

Answer all these questions as quickly as possible !

Input Format

First line has two integers , denoting the number of nodes in the graph and , denoting the number of edges in the graph. 
The next  lines each consist of three space separated integers   , where  and  denote the two nodes between which the directed edge  exists,  denotes the length of the edge between the corresponding edges. 
The next line contains a single integer , denoting number of queries. 
The next  lines each, contain two space separated integers  and , denoting the node numbers specified according to the question.
