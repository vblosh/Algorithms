Davis has  staircases in his house and he likes to climb each staircase , , or  steps at a time. Being a very precocious child, he wonders how many ways there are to reach the top of the staircase.

Given the respective heights for each of the  staircases in his house, find and print the number of ways he can climb each staircase on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of staircases in his house.

Explanation

Let's calculate the number of ways of climbing the first two of the Davis'  staircases:

The first staircase only has  step, so there is only one way for him to climb it (i.e., by jumping  step). Thus, we print  on a new line.
The second staircase has  steps and he can climb it in any of the four following ways: 
Thus, we print  on a new line.
